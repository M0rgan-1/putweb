    <p>Customer requirements refer to the specifications or features of a product or service that are deemed necessary by customers. These requirements motivate customers to buy a product or service. To determine customer requirements, companies can research their target market to understand their desires and needs.</p>
    <img src="MicrosoftTeams-image (1).png">
    <p>Customer requirements are what the customer wants you as a developer to create for them; clients will have specific things they particularly want for you to integrate into your design. When you talk to your client, you need to get to know their business and prepare an independent proposal that you will follow up on and use to help create the product. When you meet with the customer, be sure to ask questions not only to improve your understanding, but also to help you create a better product. When the product is nearly complete and you're almost ready to post the product online or ship it to the customer just before you do, make sure you meet with them and they're happy with your product.</p>
